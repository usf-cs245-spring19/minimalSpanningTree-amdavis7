/**
 * A class that represents a graph: stores the array of city nodes, the
 * adjacency list, as well as the hash table that maps city names to node ids.
 * Nodes are cities (of type CityNode); edges connect them and the cost of each edge
 * is the distance between the cities.
 * Fill in code in this class. You may add additional methods and variables.
 * You are required to implement a PriorityQueue from scratch, instead of using Java's built in.
